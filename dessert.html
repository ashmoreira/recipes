                     <li>place the blackberries, the sugar, and the lemon juice in a medium saucepan. cook the blackberries over medium heat, stirring every so often, for about 10 minutes. press the blackberries against the side of the pan to help crushing them.</li>
                     <li>if the mixture is drying and sticking to the bottom of the pan, add one tablespoon of water, or more as needed.</li>
                     <li>mix the cornstarch and water together until the cornstarch has dissolved</li>
                     <li>once the blackberries have dissolved and the mixture is thick and syrupy, add the dissolved cornstarch to the pan and immediately mix with a spatula. cook for 2 minutes, stirring, until the sauce is thick.</li>
                     <li>remove the sauce from the heat, and pour into a fine-mesh strainer over a bowl, to retain the seeds and the core of the blackberries. press the blackberries down in order to obtain as much sauce as possible. put in fridge to cool</li>
                     <li>pre-heat the oven to 325ºF.</li>
                     <li>place the graham cracker in a food processor and process to obtain fine crumbs.</li>
                     <li>add the brown sugar and mix to combine.</li>
                     <li>melt the butter and mix with the crumbs and sugar.</li>
                     <li>press the mixture on the bottom of an 8” or 9” cheesecake pan. if using an 8” springform pan, it must be deep.</li>
                     <li>bake the crust in the oven for 10 minutes.</li>
                     <li>remove it from the oven and let it cool down.</li>
                     <li>grease the sides of the cheesecake pan.</li>
                     <li>beat the cream cheese for 3 minutes with a mixer at medium speed, until creamy.</li>
                     <li>add the granulated sugar to the bowl and beat for 2 minutes at medium speed.</li>
                     <li>scrape the bowl and beat for another 30 seconds. add the sour cream and mix to combine. scrape the bowl.</li>
                     <li>add the eggs one at a time to the bowl, mixing until incorporated before adding the next one. along with the last egg, add the vanilla and the salt.</li>
                     <li>pour the cheesecake batter on the bottom of the baked and cooled graham cracker crust.</li>
                     <li>place the pan in a larger roasting pan, and add hot water to the roasting pan, to form a water bath.</li>
                     <li>bake the cheesecake in the pre-heated 325ºF oven for 60 to 75 minutes.</li>
                     <li>to check if the cheesecake is done baking, give the pan a little wiggle, it should jiggle slightly in the center, but the edges should look set.</li>
                     <li>turn the oven off, and leave the cheesecake in there for 1 hour.</li>
                     <li>remove the cheesecake from the oven, let it cool down. don’t remove the ring of the pan yet, place the cheesecake in the fridge to chill for at least 6 hours.</li>
                     <li>once cheesecake is cooled, remove ring of pan and place cooled blackberry sauce and blackberries on top of the cheesecake.</li>
                     <li>let set then serve and enjoy!</li>
